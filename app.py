___This project's goal was to create a model which would allow one to add colour to old black and white images.___
'''

## Lets see how well our model works ðŸ˜Ž

1. Let's take a black and white picture of one of us
2. Then we can upload it so that we can feed it to our model
3. What does our model predict
4. Can you guess which image is the fake one? ðŸ¤”

Streamlit does not seem to like tensorflow!!!
Nor numpy?
